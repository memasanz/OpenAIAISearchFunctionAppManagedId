One Day All-Water licenses are also available. \\n5. Do I need a fishing license to fish from my private property?\\nIt depends. You DO need a license if you are fishing into public \\nwaters (such as lakes and rivers) even if you are on private land. \\nBut you don\\u2019t need a license to fish on private property in a private \\npond that is self contained and not a result of damming a public \\nstream or subject to over-flow from public water unless the land -\\nowner requires it.\\n6. What does a \\u201cdaily bag limit\\u201d for fish mean?\\nThe quantity of a species of a wildlife resource that may be lawfully \\ntaken in one day.\\n7. What does \\u201cpossession limit\\u201d for fish mean?\\nThe maximum number of fish a person may possess before return -\\ning to their residence. Possession limit is twice the daily bag on \\ngame and nongame fish, except as provided in the Outdoor Annual, \\nand does not apply to fish in the possession of or stored by a person \\nat their residence.\\n8. What does \\u201cslot limit\\u201d mean?\\nThere are two different types of slot limits:\\nFreshwater \\u2014  Slot limits mean you must release  any fish between  \\nthe slot limit numbers. For instance, a largemouth bass at a particu -\\nlar lake has a 14\\\" \\u2013 21\\\" slot limit. That means you must release \\nlargemouth bass between 14 and 21 inches. Depending on the fish \\nspecies, some lakes, reservoirs, rivers and streams have exceptions \\nto statewide freshwater harvest regulations. See the Outdoor \\nAnnual for those exceptions.\\nSaltwater \\u2014  Slot limit means you may keep  any fish between  the \\nslot limits. For example, a black drum with a 14\\\" \\u2013 30\\\" slot limit \\nmeans you may retain any black drum between 14 and 30 inches. \\nAll others must be released.\\nRemember to check your state bag and size limits before going \\nfishing.\", \"Title: LearnToFish.pdf42\\nLearn to Fish FISHING REGULATIONS\\nFishing regulations are important for several reasons. Many regulations \\nhelp assure that certain types of fish or certain areas will not be over-\\nfished. Some regulations protect certain sizes of fish, allowing for  \\nbetter fish reproduction. Fishing regulations protect the rights of all \\nanglers as well as the rights of landowners. Below are answers to some \\nof the most frequently asked questions about fishing regulations.\\n1. Where do I find all fish and wildlife regulations for the state of Texas? \\nFishing and wildlife regulations are found in the Texas Parks and \\nWildlife Outdoor Annual. The regulations are also available on the \\nfree Outdoor Annual App or online at www.tpwd.texas.gov/oa/fishing . \\nLimited print copies are sometimes available from TPWD. \\nIf you have a question or need clarification, contact your local game \\nwarden or regional Texas Parks and Wildlife law enforcement office. \\nYou can find those numbers online at www.tpwd.texas.gov/warden .\\n2. Is a fishing license required to fish in Texas?\\nYes, a valid fishing license with a freshwater or saltwater endorse -\\nment is required of any person who fishes or takes fish, mussels, \\nclams, crayfish, or other aquatic life in the public waters of Texas.\\nIn addition, recreational anglers must have a Texas fishing license and \\nsaltwater endorsement to possess in state water any fish taken in fed -\\neral waters or possess fish on a vessel in the tidal waters of Texas.\\nSupport the Sport ~ Buy a License through the Outdoor Annual App, \\nonline or at a retailer near you. www.tpwd.texas.gov/license . \\nSee the Outdoor Annual for more information about licenses, fee \\ndiscounts and exemptions. \\n3. Are youth required to buy a license? \\nYouth under age 17 are not required to purchase a license. Youth \\nages 17 and up must have a fishing license in order to fish legally in \\npublic waters.\\n4. How often do I need to renew my fishing license?\\nAnnual fishing licenses are good for one year, with two options avail -\\nable.

Can I give another person my fish if I don\\u2019t want to bring them \\nhome? \\nYes, whether they have a fishing license or not. However, you need \\nto give them a Wildlife Resource Document (WRD) along with the \\nfish you\\u2019re giving them. A WRD form can be found in the Outdoor \\nAnnual or it can be handwritten on a piece of paper. It must have \\nthe following information:\\n\\u2022 Name, signature, address, phone number, and fishing or hunting \\nlicense number, as required, of the person who caught or killed \\nthe wildlife resource\\n\\u2022 Receiver\\u2019s name and address \\n\\u2022 Description of the fish (number and type of species or parts)\\n\\u2022 Date fish was caught or killed\\n\\u2022 Location where fish was caught or killed (name of county, lake, \\narea, bay, stream or ranch)\\n10. What if I catch a fish that is under the size limit, but it dies. \\nCan I keep it?\\nNo, if a fish dies while in your possession and it does not meet the \\nsize or bag limits, the law requires that you must still release it in \\nthe water where it will become food for other animals.\\n11. What should I do with a fish that I catch in a public waterway \\nthat I don\\u2019t want to keep because I consider it an undesirable \\nfish?  \\nYou should put it safely back in the water. It is not legal to catch \\nand purposefully kill non-game fish or fish that don\\u2019t meet the legal \\nbag and size requirements.\\n12. Are there special regulations for bait?\\nYes, there are several regulations that apply to bait. It is unlawful \\nto use game fish (whole or part) as bait. Some counties also have \\nspecific bait fish regulations, know where you are fishing and the \\nlocal regulations. \\nSee the online Outdoor Annual or App for ALL bait regulations. \", \"Title: LearnToFish.pdf48\\nLearn to Fish FISHING IN TPWD STATE PARKS\\nNo fishing license is needed at TPWD state parks* when you fish from \\nthe park property.
